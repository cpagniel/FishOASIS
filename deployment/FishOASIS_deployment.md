## Inserting Camera, Single-Board Computer, USB Storage, etc. into Ikelite Housing

## Battery Pack

To prepare the battery pack for deployment, insert 48 D cells into the battery holders and connect the male end of the Molex connector attached to the battery holders to the female end of the Molex connector. Place the battery holders, wiring and step-down converters into the PVC tube. Grease the large O-ring of the socket-connect end of the union connector glued to the PVC pipe, place the acrylic disk with the bulkhead connector on top of it and screw on the threaded union connector center. Use a strap wrench to tighten the connection.
