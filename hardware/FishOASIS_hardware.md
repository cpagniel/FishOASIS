## Battery Pack

### Gluing PVC Battery Housing

Cut the PVC pipe into a 30-inch long tube using a hacksaw or a PVC pipe cutter. 

Prime each end of the cut pipe. On one end, glue the PVC cap using the cement. On the other end, glue the union connector. A tutorial on how to prime and glue a PVC pipe can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kKVIoUhyYA&ab_channel=BenjaminSahlstrom).

Once glued, your PVC tube with end cap and union connector should look like this:

### Drill and Tap Hole for Bulkhead Connector into Acrylic Disk

Using a benchtop drill press, drill a 25/64 hole into the center of the acrylic disk. Then, run a 7/16-20 tap through the pre-drilled hole. A tutorial on how to drill and tap a hole using a benchtop drill press can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGhjsAOjfzU&ab_channel=ElectricChronicles).

Grease the O-ring on the bulkhead connector using a silicone-based grease and screw the bulkhead connector into place. The acrylic disk with bulkhead connector should look like this:

More information about the bulkhead connector can be found [here](https://www.macartney.com/what-we-offer/systems-and-products/connectors/subconn/subconn-micro-circular-series/subconn-micro-circular-2-3-4-5-6-and-8-contacts-and-g2-2-3-and-4-contacts/).

### Attach Molex Connector to Bulkhead

Strip the ends of the four wires attached to the bulkhead connector. Crimp a power connector pin (i.e., male end) to each of the four wires.
