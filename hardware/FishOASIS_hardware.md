## Battery Pack

### Gluing PVC Battery Housing

Cut the PVC pipe to xxx meters long using a hacksaw or a PVC pipe cutter. 

Prime each end of the cut pipe. On one end, glue the PVC cap using the cement. On the other end, glue the union connector. A tutorial on how to prime and glue a PVC pipe can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kKVIoUhyYA&ab_channel=BenjaminSahlstrom).

Once glued, your PVC tube with end cap and union connector should look like this:

### Drill and Tap Hole for Bulkhead Connector into Acrylic Disk

Using a benchtop drill press, drill a 25/64 hole into the acrylic disk. Then, run a 7/16-20 tap through the pre-drilled hole. A tutorial on how to tap and drill using a benchtop drill press can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGhjsAOjfzU&ab_channel=ElectricChronicles).

Grease the O-ring on the bulkheada connector using a silicone based grease and screw the bulkhead connector into place. The acrylic disk with bulkhead connector should look like this:
