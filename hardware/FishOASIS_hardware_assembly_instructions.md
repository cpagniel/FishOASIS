1. Ikelite Housing
- drill connector location
- drill & tap, connector screws down into it
- SeaConn website for connector (7/16 by 20??? thread size)

1b. SeaConn Connector
- solder micro USB to power both camera and RPi 
- solder to white connector plastic thingies (called Molex connectors)
- could use 3 pin connector to power both instead of a 4 pin connector

2. Battery Housing
- gluing PVC, primer and cement glue
- drill connector on plastic plate (tap & drill)
- plastic plate from McMaster Carr???
- if you don't need to see into housing, could use plastic plug

what size hole to drill into plate?
maybe: H/16 ?? H3S ?? (look up specs of bulkheads)

2a. Battery pack wiring
- what is wiring?
- 4 x 3 D battery per line in series = 18 V, 20 Amps/h
- 4 x 12 D battery (lines above) in parralel, 18 V nominal, 80 Amps/h
- wiring to get to 2 step-down converter, instead buck-boost converter?
- 7.5 V for sony alpha camera, 5.2 V RPi set step-down converter
- converter to bulkhead, white connector plastic thingies

Battery Pack:
1+ 2- camera 7.9 v
3+ 4- rpi 5.2 v

draw a diagram of wiring (I really don't want to take one apart)
check photos sent to Jack while building new pack

2b. Mini-speaker

- solder to Pi
- what GPIO pins to connect to?
- code for mini-speaker

3. Plugging everywhere else

3b. Making connector
- pouring polyurethane resin
- soldering wires, heating shrink, same colors
- plastic tubing
- sheathing

4. Building cement stand
- drill holes into U post
